# Twitter Watchdog for U2
A Greasemonkey (Firefox)/Tampermonkey (Google Chrome) script for use on Twitter.

# About
This script is specially made for U2 fans who want to follow all the live streams of their shows. It gets activated on Twitter when you search for "U2 periscope", goes automatically through the search results, gathers all links to Periscope streams of a U2 show and displays the links in an easy list on the left side of the page. It also does a search for any Mixlr streams and lists links to those as well and when you click one of those links a special player is embeded above the search results. It also monitors the U2 Meerkat stream and notifies you when it goes live.

# Installation
First you either have to install Greasemonkey (if you use Firefox) or Tampermonkey (if you use Chrome) and then all you need to do is to just install the script.
